#Accounts and users

GeoNode is primarily a social platform, and thus a primary component of any GeoNode instance is the user account. This section will guide you through account registration, updating your account information, and viewing other user accounts.

#Creating a new account
Before you can save or edit any layers on a GeoNode instance, you need to create an account.

1. From any page in the web interface, you will see a Sign in link. Click that link, and in the dialog that displays, click the Register now link.

3. You will be returned to the welcome page. An email will be sent confirming that you have signed up. While you are now logged in, you will need to confirm your account. Navigate to the link that was sent in the email.
